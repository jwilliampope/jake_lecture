            Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All transporters
            off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton generator is
            depolarized. Unidentified vessel travelling at sub warp speed,
            bearing 235.7. Fluctuations in energy readings from it, Captain. All
            transporters off. A strange set-up, but I'd say the graviton
            generator is depolarized. The dark colourings of the scrapes are the
            leavings of natural rubber, a type of non-conductive sole used by
            researchers experimenting with electricity. The molecules must have
            been partly de-phased by the anyon beam.
